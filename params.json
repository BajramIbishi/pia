{"name":"Pia","tagline":"PIA - Protein Inference Algorithm","body":"PIA - Protein Inference Algorithms\r\n===\r\n\r\nPIA is a toolbox for MS based protein inference and identification analysis.\r\n\r\nPIA in a nutshell\r\n===\r\n\r\nMost search engines for protein identification in MS/MS experiments return\r\nprotein lists, although the actual search yields a set of peptide spectrum\r\nmatches (PSMs). The step from PSMs to proteins is called “protein inference”.\r\nIf a set of identified PSMs supports the detection of more than one protein in\r\nthe searched database (“protein ambiguity”), usually only one representative\r\naccession is reported. These representatives may differ according to the used\r\nsearch engine and settings. Thus the protein lists of different search engines\r\ngenerally cannot be compared with one another. PSMs of complementary search\r\nengines are often combined to enhance the number of reported proteins or to\r\nverify the evidence of a peptide, which is improved by detection with distinct\r\nalgorithms.\r\n\r\nWe developed an algorithm suite written in Java, including a fully\r\nparametrisable web-interface (using JavaServer Faces), which combines PSMs from\r\ndifferent experiments and/or search engines, and reports consistent and thus\r\ncomparable results. None of the parameters for the inference, like filtering or\r\nscoring, are fixed as in prior approaches, but held as flexible as possible, to\r\nallow for any adjustments needed by the user.\r\n\r\nPIA can be called via the command line, via\r\n[GenericKnimeNodes](https://github.com/genericworkflownodes/GenericKnimeNodes) in\r\nKNIME or using the JavaServer Faces web-interface.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
