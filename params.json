{"name":"PIA - Protein Inference Algorithms","tagline":"","body":"PIA is a toolbox for MS based protein inference and identification analysis.\r\n\r\nPIA allows you to inspect the results of common proteomics spectrum\r\nidentification search engines, combine them seamlessly and conduct statistical \r\nanalyses.\r\nThe main focus of PIA lays on the integrated inference algorithms, i.e.\r\nconcluding the proteins from a set of identified spectra. But it also allows\r\nyou to inspect your peptide spectrum matches, calculate FDR values across\r\ndifferent search engine results and visualize the correspondence between PSMs,\r\npeptides and proteins.\r\n\r\n![PIA - Logo](https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/pia/wiki/pia_logo.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nPIA in a nutshell\r\n=================\r\n\r\nMost search engines for protein identification in MS/MS experiments return\r\nprotein lists, although the actual search yields a set of peptide spectrum\r\nmatches (PSMs). The step from PSMs to proteins is called “protein inference”.\r\nIf a set of identified PSMs supports the detection of more than one protein in\r\nthe searched database (“protein ambiguity”), usually only one representative\r\naccession is reported. These representatives may differ according to the used\r\nsearch engine and settings. Thus the protein lists of different search engines\r\ngenerally cannot be compared with one another. PSMs of complementary search\r\nengines are often combined to enhance the number of reported proteins or to\r\nverify the evidence of a peptide, which is improved by detection with distinct\r\nalgorithms.\r\n\r\nWe developed an algorithm suite written in Java, including a fully\r\nparametrisable web-interface (using JavaServer Faces), which combines PSMs from\r\ndifferent experiments and/or search engines, and reports consistent and thus\r\ncomparable results. None of the parameters for the inference, like filtering or\r\nscoring, are fixed as in prior approaches, but held as flexible as possible, to\r\nallow for any adjustments needed by the user.\r\n\r\nPIA can be called via the command line, in the workflow environment KNIME or\r\nusing a web-interface (which requires an installation of a web server, but feel\r\nfree to test it using the test server).\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n========\r\nFor how to install and run PIA inside KNIME see [the wiki about PIA in KNIME](https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/pia/wiki/Running-PIA-via-KNIME).\r\n\r\nDownload the latest released version [here](https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/pia/releases/latest) or on the top of the page.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nFor documentation please refer to the Wiki (https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/pia/wiki) on github.\r\n\r\n\r\nProblems, Bugs and Issues\r\n=========================\r\nIf you have any problems with PIA or find bugs and other issues, please use the\r\nissue tracker of github (https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/pia/issues).\r\n\r\n\r\nCitation and Publication\r\n========================\r\nIf you found PIA useful for your work, please cite the following publication:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25938255\r\n\r\n\r\nTest Server\r\n===\r\n\r\nWe provide a test installation of the web interface on http://134.147.84.213:8080/pia/\r\n\r\nIn your own interest, don't sent any sensitive research data to this server!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
